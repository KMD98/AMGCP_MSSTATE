# Autonomous Off-road 4WD Robot with Level 3 Autonomy
  - This is a code repository for Mississippi State University ABE and GRI department for the autonomous mobile ground control point robot that works in collaboration with drone flight plan.
  - The robot runs 1 sensor fusion node (local planner). Visual inertial (ZED) in its local frame. GPSRTK in global frame (an EKF development in the future would increase global navigation rate). All global frame trajectory is translate and rotate into local frame instead of the opposite direction to reduce uncertainty and computational cost. 
  - The robot perform collision avoidance with A* algorithm on a 2D occupancy map created from stereo 3D Point Cloud
  - The robot detect ground plane with RANSAC to generate Occupancy map
  - The robot has a manual controller device that is required for operation. The code is under manual controller and the manual inputs are activated if the user flip the manual operation switch on the controller.
  - The robot navigates based on chosen waypoints
  - The robot design DOES NOT HAVE BRAKES. It is at the mercy of inertia
  - The robot weighs 400lbs
